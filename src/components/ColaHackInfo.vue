        <h4 class="light-title">// What is a Hack-a-Thon?</h4>
        <p class="text-desc"> Major League Hacking (MLH) defines a hackation as:
            "A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a 
            hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.
            You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science."

        <h4 class="light-title">// Why should I go?</h4>

        <p class="text-desc"> 
            Besides the variety of prizes that will be given away, there are may reasons!
            <br>
            <br>
            If you've ever had an idea, but thought you didn't have the time, skills, or energy to do it a hackathon is 
            a great place to get started. You can take 12 hours and flesh out your idea, and begin bringing it to life. While
            you're hacking away, you may make new friends who would like to join your team in creating your app idea. If you need,
            a little extra help there will be mentors and volunteers to provide advice if you need some extra
            help along the way.

            <br>
            <br>

            Besides just building an app, hackathons are a great way to build your network. You'll be able to meet some 
            of our company sponsors representatives, meet faculty and staff within the school, and other students who are
            passionate about programming.

            <br>
            <br>

            And more importantly you'll be learning something new. Every minute you spend working on your project, you'll
            learn something new along the way. And ultimately, that is the main goal of the hackathon. To ensure that students
            of all skill levels and interests learn something new along the way.
