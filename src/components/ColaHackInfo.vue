            <h4 class="light-title">// What is a Hackathon?</h4>
            <p class="text-desc"> Major League Hacking (MLH) defines a hackathon as:
                "... an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a 
                hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.
                You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science."

                Besides the variety of prizes that will be given away, there are may reasons!
                <br>
                <br>
                If you've ever had an idea, but thought you didn't have the time, skills, or energy to do it a hackathon is 
                a great place to get started. You can take 12 hours and flesh out your idea, and begin bringing it to life. While
                you're hacking away, you may make new friends who would like to join your team in creating your app idea. If you need,
                a little extra help there will be mentors and volunteers to provide advice if you need some extra
                help along the way.

                <br>
                <br>

                Around the time you'll be building your app, you'll also grow network. You'll be able to meet some 
                of our company sponsors representatives, meet faculty and staff within the school, and other students who are
                passionate about programming.

                <br>
                <br>

                Every minute you spend working on your project, you'll
                learn something new along the way. And ultimately, that is the main goal of the hackathon. To ensure that students
                of all skill levels and interests learn while having a good time.
