<p><strong>Collection/Use of Your Information</strong>. As described in more detail below in these Terms and Conditions, University of South Carolina may ask you for additional information to confirm that you are in compliance with these Terms and Conditions and/or (if applicable) are eligible to receive prizes. Your failure to provide such information within the requested timeframe may render you ineligible.

<p><strong>How do I form a Team?</strong> A team can include 1-4 Participants (a “<strong>Team</strong>”).

<p><strong>How do I become eligible to win prizes?</strong> In order to be eligible to compete for Team prizes, all members of the Team must be registered Participants Prospective winners may be contacted in person at the event or by using the email address provided in the person’s registration. As described in more detail below in these Terms and Conditions, prospective winners will be required to provide any requested proof of eligibility and to sign additional paperwork in order to be formally declared winners and to claim prizes.</p>
<p><strong>Determination of Winners.</strong> Winners will be judged based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong>Did the hack actually serve to help the Columbia/community? What is the impact of your hack?</p>
        </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go “Wow”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Completion:</strong> Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning:</strong> Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prizes.</strong> The available Team prizes are subject to and incorporated into these Terms and Conditions and can be found <strong><a href="./prizes.html">here</a></strong> The prize listings may be supplemented or modified from time to time in USC’s sole discretion.</p>
